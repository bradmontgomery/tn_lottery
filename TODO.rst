Build a simulator
-----------------
Inputs:
- How often the game is played (e.g. 2 times / week for powerball)
- How much a ticket costs (and how many you play at a time?)
- How long you want to play (e.g. play for 20 years). Assume you play every
  time the game runs. (forever mode: keep playing until we hit the jackpot)

Output:
- How much money you've spent
- How much you've won.
- How long it takes to win? (e.g. how many years to hit the jackpot)
- Print the output in a text table.

Would be cool to see a graph of money spent vs. winnings over time.
- assuming we count minor winnings (match PB, match 2/5 etc).
- For examples of ways to win: http://goo.gl/2UT2jq
